# datatable12

I need to make a table with multiple row selection. And with the possibility of disclosing additional information in the form of a table.
To do this, I use the PrimeFaces 12 framework and Datatable with multiple row selection and with row expand.

There was a problem with multiple row selection in the table.
The Alt meta key does not work.
When the selected row is clicked, it remains selected.

In the disclosed table, the situation is the same.
When a row is selected in the expanded page, the selection event is also transmitted to the parent table.
